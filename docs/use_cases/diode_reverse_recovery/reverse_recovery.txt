Summary:

A general diode might have a reverse recovery time on the order of nanoseconds.
The current SSMU's microcontroller has an ADC w/ max 1MSPS sampling rate.
However, there are fairly cheap ($0.48) diodes with recovery times in the range of 18-20 microseconds.

Testing:

Connect the diode such that the cathode is connected to the load resistor. Forward bias the diode. 
Make sure the load resistor is large enough so you don't blow out the diode.
Reverse bias the diode and begin capturing the voltage at Vout
Since Vin/Vout will be from the same microcontroller, we shouldn't have to worry about sync/trigger lines
